The Ocarina of Time Speedrun community only allows leaderboard submissions played on emulators, that are at least 10%
slower than the current world record. This website aims at presenting these cutoffs, so both runners and moderators can
see if any given run qualifies to be put on the leaderboards.

## Local Setup

### Requirements

* Node.js >= 18
* NPM >= 9

### Start the Development Server

First run `npm i` to download all necessary dependencies. Start the server with the `npm start` command.
